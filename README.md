## Hackathons

### What?

In general, hackathons:

-   are short competitions - usually ranging from one weekend to one month
-   have participants form teams - usually of 2-4 people each
-   have a theme or prompt - e.g., "Scaling Ethereum"
-   include prizes for the winning team(s)

### Why?

There are plenty of reasons to participate:

-   Networking/making friends
-   Test and level-up your skills
-   Exposure to new technology, tools, and problem areas
-   Receive mentorship
-   Adding to your CV
-   Build public goods (open source software)
-   Potential prize winnings
-   Meeting potential employers and project funders
-   Fun: build/try new things, explore workshops/the venue/the city

### How?

Most hackathons are free to join. Getting to the event and paying for your accommodations is another matter. Some scholarship opportuntities exist. Check first if the event you're interested in has such a program.

Within Developer DAO, we're experimenting with a Hackathon Support Team which:

-   maintains an event calendar,
-   helps members find and form teams, and
-   collects, builds, and curates resources in this repository.
